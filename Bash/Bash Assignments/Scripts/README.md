# ðŸš€ From Windows to Bash â€“ A DevOps Adventure!

Starting my Bash scripting journey has been an interesting shift coming from a Windows background. Bash is a powerful tool that plays a huge role in automation, server management, and general efficiencyâ€”especially in DevOps.

Since Linux is at the core of many modern infrastructures, getting comfortable with Bash is a must for working with cloud platforms, containers, and CI/CD pipelines. This repo is where Iâ€™ll be sharing my progress, scripts, and lessons learned along the way.

Excited to see how far this goes! ðŸš€
