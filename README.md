## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into multiple modules, each representing a core area of DevOps. You will find a dedicated folder for each module where you can store your notes, labs, and any other relevant materials.

## Sample Directory Structure

Here's how your directory structure should look like as you progress through the bootcamp. This is an example of what your repository might look like after completing a few modules:

Example layout for repo only. Yours could be different but this is inspiration.
