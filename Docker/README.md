# Flask App using Docker Compose
---
This is a simple project that demonstrated using a Python Flask web application orchestrated with Docker Compose.

# Project Setup
---

First things first, we need to setup project directory and create the required files.

1. **Create the Project Directory**
     ``` bash
     mkdir Docker/hello_flask
     cd Docker/hello_flask

2. **Create Files:**

   Creat the following files in your directory
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `flask-app.py`
   - `docker-compose.yml`
   - `requirements.txt`
  
   These files can be created using the touch command:
   ``` bash
   touch Dockerfile flask-app-py docker-compose.yml requirements.txt
   ```
