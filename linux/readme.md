# Learning Linux

Having only ever used Windows machines since Windows 98, learning to use Linux has been quite a shift from what I'm used to. The difference in user interface, file management, and system commands initially felt overwhelming, but as I've spent more time with Linux, it has become an exciting challenge. Iâ€™ve enjoyed learning the command line, understanding the underlying principles of how Linux works and understanding how powerful of a tool it is. 

# OverTheWire Bandit

I learn best by doing rather than watching or reading documentation. This is where OverTheWire Bandit came in. Its a game designed to teach Linux fundamentals through a series of challenges. Each level presents a new concept or command, guiding me in learning how to navigate and interact with the system.

I have created sub-folders for what the aim of each level is and what commands I used to beat it and progress to the next level.
