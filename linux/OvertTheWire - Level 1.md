# OverTheWire Bandit - Level 1
The goal of this level is to find the password for the next level. Its stored in a file called `-` located in the home directory.

# Solution

We SSH into level 1 using `bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`. You will then be asked for a password. Use the password you found in level 0:
```bash
